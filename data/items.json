This started out as a perfectly round bowl but has warped and moved to find it&#39;s own shape.  It&#39;s very tactile and has settled into a lovely organic shape.  **It&#39;s fairly dry now but may move more, especially if your home is warmer or drier than mine. This may include cracking and splitting as well as warping and moving.  This is a natural process.  The wood came from a tree surgeon friend who removed an overgrown tree for a customer.\n\nIt&#39;s finished with walnut oil.\n\n155mm x 135mm &#39;diameter&#39; x 70mm high\n\nAll of the wood I use for my bowls comes from trees grown in the UK from sustainable sources.  The majority of it comes from my own garden – either trimmings or from trees removed as part of regular management.  Other wood comes from friends and neighbours who have had trees trimmed or removed.  A few bowls are made from wood bought from a supplier of bowl blanks – this is not a source I use any more, not for any environmental or other concerns, simply because I have a very good stock of more local wood now.  For the future I intend that all of the wood I use will be local and that the source and reason for felling will be verifiable.  This provenance is important to me as far too man y trees are felled for no good reason without being replaced.\n\nMy bowls are all turned on a lathe and finished by hand.  They are not perfect specimen pieces – they are real pieces of wood complete with marks, knots, cracks, twists and warps.  Many are turned ‘green’ (which means fairly fresh after being cut and still quite wet) and as such will continue to dry and find their final shape for some time yet.  This is a natural process and only adds to the unique character of each individual piece.  \n\nThey are all finished with either wax or oil, see the in individual descriptions for each bowl.  They are ‘food safe’ for use as fruit bowls but I would not recommend using them to eat from.  They would benefit from the occasional waxing (standard furniture wax is fine) or oiling (walnut oil from the supermarket is good), just a light wipe is fine to keep them looking their best.  \n\nDon’t  soak in water (wipe with a damp cloth and dry straight away) and avoid direct sunlight for any extended period.

    "name": "CANNA THERAPY Cannabis Cream With Full Plant Extract- anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, regenerating and rejuvenating effect",
    "description": "Why hemp cosmetics?\n\nLeave the soft drugs prejudices aside and take a look at cannabis from a different perspective. Despite the notoriety of plant’s reputation, it has proven medicinal and cosmetic qualities. Hemp products are highly valued natural cosmetics. Do you wonder why?\n\nThe antiseptic, antibacterial and energizing characteristics of the herb are known to man for centuries. Since ancient times, hemp was widely used against herpes, eczema and various rashes as well as skin problems of any kind.\n\nHemp seeds are not marijuana seeds\n\nNow is the time to make an important clarification: Hemp seeds are not marijuana seeds, confusing both is common misconception. All types of hemp used in the food, textile and cosmetic industries are specifically cultivated Cannabis crosses generally called industrial hemp. The plant has three major subtypes: Cannabis Sativa, Cannabis Indica and Cannabis Ruderalis. Those designed for everyday use are selected as not to contain (or contain negligible amounts) of the psychoactive substance THC, which is the substance marijuana owes its effect to. It is important to know regarding hemp seed and the seed oil extract, that THC is located in the flowers of the plant not in its seeds.\n\nWhat makes the hemp oil valuable?\n\nHemp oil contains more natural essential fatty acids than any other oil extracted from plants in perfect ratio 3:1 - Omega-6: Omega-3. Contains vitamin E which is a natural antioxidant. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is very close in composition to the fat cells in the human body. This makes cannabis extract unique for deep hydration of skin cell structures as our body does not manufacture these acids by itself. Hemp also contains a complex of vitamins A, B, C, D and E, essential to skin care. It provides the skin with effective sun protection during summer, and reduces the effects of cold-warm transition or vice versa during winter.\n\nHemp oil has an exceptional effect:\n\nMoisturizes the skin and brings it to a new life; makes tan uniform; regenerates cells;\nProtects against the harmful effects of the environment - wind, sun, UV rays, pollution.\nHas an anti-inflammatory effect. Highly suitable for dry and devitalized skin; with problems such as acne, eczema, psoriasis.\n\nWhom is hemp cosmetics suitable for?\n\nNatural hemp cosmetics in the form of creams and ointments protect the skin cells from the adverse external conditions by taking care of the water preservation in the cells, preventing from premature aging. A great advantage is the delicacy of the cannabis extract, making it suitable for sensitive and allergic skin prone to acne.\n\nDaily use of the hemp cosmetics has primarily a preventive cosmetic function, but has also a favorable effect on some common skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis or acne.\n\nThe Canna Therapy cream\n\nThe Canna Therapy cream is prepared using advanced technology based on lipophilic-acrylic matrix that reduces irritating emulsifiers. The texture of the Canna Therapy cream is very light, absorbs instantly, does not irritate the skin and leaves no greasy residue. Thanks to its BIO formula, the cream does not contain any petroleum products or animal products, solvents, sulfates, silicones, paragons and artificial colors. Cold pressed hemp oil contains essential fatty acids and gamma-linolenic acid, which takes care of the development of the natural barrier function of the skin.\n\nWe have combined the hemp oil carefully with organic unrefined oils from macadamia, almond and rose at a controlled temperature, so as to retain the natural bioactive properties of the oils. Along with the hydrating ingredients such as glycerin, panthenol, valuable natural oils form almond, rose and macadamia the cream is enriched with natural UV filters, protective vitamin E and regenerating and Anti-aging BIO serum. The Canna Therapy cream is suitable for daily care for all skin types, even if very sensitive or problematic skin.\n\n\nThe Canna Therapy cosmetics are unique containing not only hemp oil, but also Cannabis Sativa extract - a source of unsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids and phytosterols, range natural antioxidants, biominerals, vitamins, carotenoids and chlorophylls. Facial cream Canna Therapy has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergenic and regenerating effect. The product has positive effects on various dermatitis, atopic eczema, psoriasis and acne. By its nourishing natural ingredients the Canna Therapy cream provides a natural protective film for easily irritated and sensitive skin prone to dryness and cracking. The cream contains vitamin B8 inositol vitamin of youth, vitality and health with superb biostimulating and antioxidant effect.\n\n\nWhile Carnosine prevents glycation of proteins and keeps skin &quot;forever young&quot; cyclic pentapeptide and ceramides are involved in the renovation, preservation and hydration of the skin cell structures. The skin becomes smooth, elastic, tight and silky. Anti-age complex gradually smooth out wrinkles, makes tan uniform and ameliorates the skin structure, leaving the skin beautiful and with optimal level of hydration.",

Ее подвешивали либо над постелью больного, либо над колыбелью новорожденного. В последнем случае, Травница также помогала отогнать злых духов от младенца, к тому же служила для ребенка забавой. Мамы перед сном разминали куклу, и тогда аромат трав усиливался, успокаивая малыша и даруя ему здоровый сон.\nОкунувшись в аромат Кубышки-Травницы, мы обретаем душевный покой, легкость дыхания и ясность мысли.\nКубышка наполнена мятой,мелиссой,лавандой и валерьяной.\nМята перечная -и успокаивает, и тонизирует (в зависимости от количества), лечит нервные расстройства, а также стимулирует работу мозга, дарит спокойный сон.\nЛаванда – успокоительное средство как для нервной системы, так и для дыхательных путей,очищает воздух и убивает болезнетворные бактерии. А еще лаванда способна подарить любовь и счастье, увеличить взаимопонимание и избавить дом от негативной энергии.\nВалериана – поднимает настроение, помогает обрести гармонию,улучшает атмосферу жилища, снижает количество ссор и помогает достичь взаимопонимания.\nМелисса -пПомогает при снижении умственной и физической работоспособ­ности, меланхолии,повышает опти­мизм, способствует удаче в жизни, укрепляет меха­низмы энергетического регулирования.\nЭта куколка привнесет в дом и семью взаимопонимание и согласие, поэтому набор трав в ней не случайный :)\nКубышка-травница– прекрасный и очень уютный подарок друзьям, родным и близким.",

It is stamped with the artist&#39;s signature and the item #BL-32TB. This was purchased at an upscale needlepoint shop by a friend and she decided not to do it due to problems with her hand. I&#39;m listing it for her. Great project to use up some of your leftover needlepoint yarns and do different interesting stitches. Beading and metallics added would make it a STUNNING wall hanging or could be finished into a gorgeous pillow. Great winter project! Save over $100 off purchased price at store.\n\nCanvas size is  18 1/2&quot; X 16 1/2&quot;. Finished size is 14&quot; by 12&quot;.  Will mail in a tube to prevent creasing.

    "description": "Original Items: One-of-a-kind-set. This is quality material, dating from the Reign of Queen Elizabeth II who came to the throne in 1953. Buckingham Palace in central London is the official residence of the Queen although she has many country estates. The Household Cavalry (HCav) is made up of the two most senior regiments of the British Army, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons). These regiments are divided between the Armoured Regiment stationed at Combermere Barracks in Windsor and the ceremonial mounted unit, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, garrisoned at Hyde Park Barracks (Knightsbridge Barracks) in London. The Household Cavalry is part of the Household Division and is the Queen&#39;s official bodyguard.\n\nThe British Household Cavalry is classed as a corps in its own right, and consists of two regiments: the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons). They are the senior regular regiments in the British Army, with traditions dating from 1660, and act as the Queen&#39;s personal bodyguard. They are guards regiments and, with the five foot guard regiments, help constitute the seven guards regiments of the Household Division.\n\nHere we offer a complete cuirass set (chest and back plate) with helmet of Lieutenant BARLOW of the Life Guards.\n\nOfficer&#39;s Uniforms are far more elaborate than for the standard trooper uniforms. The helmet plates and mounts are gilt and the cuirasses are lined in velvet. Officer’s uniforms are very expensive with no cost spared being in the direct service of the Monarch. This set, just received from an English collection, is in excellent condition and bears Lt. BARLOW&#39;s name on the inside of the breast and back plate. A magnificent set rarely encountered.",

    "name": "Original WWII Guinness Advertising Oil on Canvas Artwork by John Gilroy - 1944 Royal Navy Submarine Crew [ON8505]",
    "description": "Original Item: One-of-a-kind. This is a fascinating story! We&#39;ve all heard of Guinness, a popular Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness (1725–1803) at St. James&#39;s Gate, Dublin. Guinness is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide. It is brewed in nearly 60 countries and is available in over 120, with annual sales totaling 850 million liters (1.5 billion Imperial or 1.8 billion US pints).\n\nWell, what we have here is an original oil painting by the dedicated Guinness advertising account artist John Gilroy. These painting were first created and once approved internally by the advertising agency and then the client (in this case Guinness) posters would be printed and pasted all over the UK.\n\nThis particular example is one of the very few WW2 Guinness advertisements. It reads:\n\nGUINNESS - FOR STRENGTH\n\n\nThis completely authentic first generation oil painting is beautifully preserved and framed. It even still bears the original paper S.H. Benson advertising agency paper tag that is clearly dated 1944.\n\nThe tag reads as follows:\n\nS.H. Benson\n-Advertising Agency-\nClient: Guinness\nAccount: GE/44\nArtist: GILROY\nAction: SUBMIT TO CENSOR\n\n\n\nGuinness&#39;s iconic stature is partly due to its advertising, the most notable and recognizable series of advertisements was created by S.H. Benson&#39;s advertising, primarily drawn by the artist John Gilroy, in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nBenson created posters that included phrases such as &quot;Guinness for Strength&quot;, &quot;Lovely Day for a Guinness&quot;, &quot;Guinness Makes You Strong,&quot; &quot;My Goodness My Guinness,&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;My Goodness, My Christmas, It&#39;s Guinness!&quot;) and, &quot;Guinness is Good For You&quot;. The posters featured Gilroy&#39;s distinctive artwork and more often than not featured animals such as a kangaroo, ostrich, seal, lion and notably a toucan, which has become as much a symbol of Guinness as the harp.\n\nThe genuine one-of-a-kind oil painting measures 34 inches wide by 29 inches tall. The original canvas was mounted on board and one can still see the thumbtack impressions along the margins. The painting is signed GILROY in the bottom left corner.\n\nThis particular painting depicts a sailor in the Royal Navy crossing a wooden gangplank from the wharf to a submarine with a massive torpedo slung over his shoulder. Standing beside him on the dockside is an iron stanchion with an empty glass and a bottle of Guinness next to it (as if he has just drunk it, like Popeye eats spinach).\n\nOn of the most compelling aspects of this particular work are the copious pencil notes on the canvas, presumably written by the creative account manager at S.H. Benson that read as follows:\n\nMake figures smaller\nlonger torpedo\nlonger gang plank\nfind reference for Conning Tower\nAdd man in hatch?\n\n\nA charming advertisement intended to boost morale during WW2, and one of only a very few in Gilroy’s short-lived Guinness WWII series, making it not only one-of-a-kind but extremely rare.\n\nIncluded with this framed painting comes a signed copy of the 255 page book; GILROY WAS GOOD FOR GUINNESS. The book shows Gilroy’s history with Guinness and illustrates this very painting on page 177.\n\nGilroy was Great Britain&#39;s Norman Rockwell and a treasure trove has been discovered, over the next years the prices will skyrocket and especially on those few that have a piece from the extremely rare WW2 series.\n\n\nFounded by Arthur Guinness, 1725-1803, this dark nectar was first marketed in 1778. It has climbed in popularity over the next 235 years. In 1932 it moved its headquarters from Dublin to London and was then rated the 7th largest Company in the world. On moving to London Guinness contracted with the S. H. Benson Advertising Agency and for the next thirty years one of the greatest advertising campaigns came into being. Basically this was all because of the renowned commercial artist JOHN GILROY. England&#39;s equivalent to Norman Rockwell.\n\nFor thirty years Gilroy created some of the most loved Post Advertising of all time. He created the famous Zoo Series including his use of animals, such as Ostriches, Toucans and Gnus, a WW2 Series, an Old Masters series, an Olympic series for 1948 London Games and an Exotic Automobile series as well as countless others.\n\nThe point was to promote the benefits that &quot;Guinness was Good For You&quot;, and &quot;Guinness For Strength&quot;, creating a truly enchanting series of Campaigns that are still near to many people&#39;s hearts.\n\nIn 1962 a new Marketing team joined Guinness and terminated its contracts with Bensons and within short order the S.H. Benson advertising agency closed down with all it&#39;s archives being placed in storage. In 2010 this came to light and over 200 original oil paintings, original works of John Gilroy, were discovered. Any Gilroy work will now become a most rewarding investment. John Gilroy Died in 1985 just a month short of his 87th birthday.",

    "name": "Original German M40 WWII Type Steel Helmet- Finnish M40/55 Contract - Scratch & Dent [GG4055SD]",
    "description": "Original Item: These are helmets that have serious imperfections in the shell that prevents them from being sold as Grade one. Offered as is, no size selection.\n\nIn another military antiques coup, IMA has just acquired the last of all the known WWII helmet stocks (thousands!) from the government of Finland. These helmets are 100% genuine German manufactured WWII type M40 steel combat helmets that were produced by German WWII helmet manufacturer Hans Römer Fabrik from Neu-Ulm (Donau-Freiberg).\n\nSupplied throughout WWII and then under special contract for the Finnish Army in 1955, hence, they have become known as the M40/55 helmet. However, these helmets were made in the same factory, on the same machines and by some of the very same people that produced them for Germany in WWII. They are nearly identical to WWII issue M40’s, (and are often sold as such) with the classic rolled edge, correct steel thickness, and pressed ventilation holes. Furthermore, we have very good reason to believe that some of these shells are “sanitized” German WWII M35 and M40 helmets; meaning some are genuine WWII shells that had all stampings rubbed out and original paint removed to avoid the allied ban on West Germany selling war materiel after WW2.\n\nThe leather liners and chinstraps were made in Finland for the Finnish army; styles vary, as some of the helmets were used up until the early 1970s. The shells do however, accept our splendid reproduction M35 WWII leather helmet liner and chinstrap with reproduction WW2 split pin and washer sets.\n\nStyles and colors (Field Grey, Field Green) may vary slightly so please see photos for variation examples. These are offered in &quot;Scratch & Dent&quot; condition and will have significant dents, scratches, etc in the shell. These are real surplus military helmets that were used by actual soldiers in the defense of their country, and some of them did not fare as well over the years.\n\nThis is a rare chance to own a genuine military issue German made M40 WWII style helmet for the almost the same price as a Chinese or Indian made reproduction. There is simply no comparison to a genuine combat helmet!\n\nHistory of Finnish Combat Helmets-\nFinland imported tens of thousands of helmets for the Winter War of 1939-40 and the Continuation War of 1941-44, and imported again in 1955. Since IMA acquired the last of all the known helmet stock from the Finnish government you may wonder did we get German WWII marked helmets? Yes, and they will be offered at a far higher price. Did we get other types of helmets? Yes, we also received Hungarian WWII M38 (1938) helmets as well. This deal is a treasure trove of WWII era combat helmet history.\n\nHistory the German & Finnish Alliance-\nIn 1938 Finland became very concerned with Stalin&#39;s Soviet expansionism and turned to Great Britain and France for support. Both Countries were under supplied themselves so Finland, perhaps reluctantly turned to Nazi Germany for aid. Hitler was swift to assist supplying great quantities of materiel including thousands of German Battle Helmets.\n\nThe Russians invaded Finland in 1939 driving deep into the country. The Finns resisted with amazing tenacity that has been the subject of legend and the wonderful WW2 Movie &quot;THE WINTER WAR&quot; (offered by IMA). The Russians paid a very heavy price and sued for peace in early 1940 keeping the invaded areas of Finland. Finland totally exhausted agreed with great regret.\n\nIn the summer of 1941 Hitler’s Nazi War Machine invaded the Soviet Union driving everything before them. Finland whom had received so much help from Germany then rose up and drove the Soviet presence out of Finland. However Finland would not &quot;invade&quot; the Soviet Union, they declared themselves not to be aggressors.\n\nIt is true however that the Germans recruited great numbers of Finnish &quot;Volunteers&quot; for their &quot;SS UNITS&quot; that did invade Mother Russia but that was true of all the overrun European Countries and even some others, still independent including apparently England and the United States, although these number were said to be very low.\n\nAt the close of WW2 with Germany defeated Finland was highly penalized by the Soviet Union, again gave up the lost territory of 1939/40 but did manage to retain it&#39;s independence unlike so much of Eastern Europe.",

    "description": "Original Items: Only One Set Available. Purchased directly from a Veteran’s family this is a wonderful U.S. WWII United States Marine Corps set comprised of the following pieces:\n\n• Size 40” WW2 USMC US Marine Corps P44 USMC Combat Uniform Field Utility Jacket in Olive Drab. It is dated 1944. This loose fitting sage green herringbone twill (HBT) cotton jacket features, original “doughnut hole” USMC buttons, gas flap, chest pocket with flap, internal breast pocket and stenciled black USMC EGA insignia. Offered in near excellent condition.\n\n• Size 32” WW2 USMC US Marine Corps P44 USMC Combat Uniform Field Utility pants in Olive Drab. These loose fitting sage green herringbone twill (HBT) cotton pants feature, original “doughnut hole” USMC buttons, hip pockets, two open rear pockets. Offered in near excellent condition.\n\n• Original WWII USMC 1944 M1 McCord Front Seam Helmet with 1943 Westinghouse Liner with Cover. The U.S. WWII M-1 helmet was only produced from 1941 to 1945. The first production batch resulted with over 323,510 M-1 helmets before the start of the American involvement in the war. This helmet is stamped &quot;124&quot; which indicates the approximate manufacture date of April 1942.\n\nThe Ordnance Department selected McCord Radiator and Manufacturing Company of Detroit Michigan to produce the steel M1 helmet bodies. These bodies were made from a single piece of Hadfield Manganese steel that was produced by the Carnegie-Illinois & Sharon Steel Corporations. Each completed raw M-1 helmet shell weighed 2.25 lbs each.\n\nThe later M-1 helmet shells had a set of swivel (movable) chinstrap loops called “bales” and a stainless steel rim. These rims were both rust resistant and had &quot;non-magnetic qualities&quot; that reduced the chance of error readings when placed around certain sensitive equipment (such as a compass).\n\nThis helmet is a fine example and still retains all of its original WW2 parts and the shell has all original &quot;corked&quot; grain paint.\n\nThe liner is correct “high pressure” WWII issue and stamped with a W for the Westinghouse Electric Co Manufactured in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania this &quot;high pressure&quot; manufactured M-1 helmet liner is identified by an embossed &quot;W&quot; in the crown (which is still Westinghouse&#39;s logo to this day). Westinghouse was the largest M-1 helmet liner producer and had two production divisions; Micarta and Bryant Electric. The Micarta Division produced about 13,000,000 M-1 helmet liners and the Bryant Electric Division about 10,000,000. Westinghouse Electric Company started M-1 helmet liner delivery in May 1942. Westinghouse did have a contract to producce airborne liners and converted an unknown amount to airborne configuration. Westinghouse discontinued production around August 17, 1945 when the war ended.\n\nThis true almost unissued US WWII M-1 helmet liner be identified through the frontal eyelet hole. Other correct WW2 features include cotton herringbone twill (HBT) cloth suspension dated 1943. This HBT suspension is held tightly within the M-1 helmet liner by rivets and a series of triangular &quot;A&quot; washers. The three upper suspension bands are joined together with a shoestring. This way the wearer could adjust the fit. The leather liner chinstrap is the early war style but is broken.\n\nThe shell chin strap is original and the helmet cover is original 1953 issue USMC in excellent condition!\n\nThis is a wonderful near excellent condition genuine WW2 U.S.M.C set that will fill the gap in any pacific theatre collection.",

    "description": "This Adventure Emporium listing is for ONE Antique Coffee Mill.\n\nIt’s hard to part with this one!\n\nA great conversation piece on any coffee table, this is the perfect gift for an antique collector looking to add a quirky piece to their collection or the entrepreneur coffee aficionado who wants a unique piece of history to add character to their coffee shop.\n\nThis Antique Coffee Mill was made by hand with fingertip tenons joining the maple wood panels at each corner of the box. The mill can be hand-cranked by holding the ornate side handle and turning the elegantly curved rotating gear handle. The decorative shield-shaped iron panel on top houses the gear handle and the access port for pouring in the coffee beans. The inner gear mechanism would be adjusted for coarse or fine grounds with the top wing nut. The mill includes a pull-out drawer with a small iron handle that can be removed to dump fresh-ground coffee into a filter.\n\nMEASUREMENTS:\n\n•\tHeight: 13&quot;\n•\tWidth: 7”\nBox:\n•\tHeight: 6.25\n•\tWidth: 5.75\nDrawer:\n•\tOutside Length: 5.3”\n•\tOutside Width: 5”\n•\tInside Depth: 1.5”\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nThis item is sold AS IS!\n\nThe coffee mill is still functional although we do not recommend using it to grind coffee for consumption. The mill has not been tested for effective grinding of coffee beans.\n\nThe access port cover can be opened. Please do not insert anything into the opening to avoid finger injury from the inner gear mechanism.\n\nThis item is worn with age, is made of unsealed, unvarnished wood (which means that you can later stain and varnish it any way you like), and has imperfections such as a little rust on the iron components, but this adds character and should not get worse if kept indoors. The top is a little loose and there are cracks on the base edges of the box. With careful use for decorative purposes, this piece will age well.\n\nMessage shopkeep for additional details.",

On the end is a small clear quartz ball to hold on to while dowsing. The entire pendulum is approximately 10 inches in length.\n\nPendulums have long been used for Divination, it is an ancient technique used to access unknown information from one&#39;s higher self, the universe etc. The basic dowsing pendulum consists of a weight and a chain. This combination creates a radiesthetic reaction in the hands of a &quot;sensitive&quot; person. In essence it will move in various directions to give an answer to a specific question posed. \n\nThis pendulum has been cleared and infused with Reiki. It comes in a pouch with an explanation of the stones&#39; metaphysical properties and how to cleanse, program, and use your new Pendulum.\n\nPlease note that Divination and the Metaphysical are a very spiritual based practice. I make no claims that this or any other tool of divination or the metaphysical can diagnose or cure any ailments or truly &quot;predict&quot; the future. We all have free will and the choice to choose our destinies.\n\nCarnelian works with the sacral chakra. It grounds and anchors in to the present surroundings.It clarifies perception and dispels apathy.\n\nRed Jasper works with the root or base chakra. It grounds energy and aids in dream recall. It also helps rectify unjust situations.\n\nOnyx is strength giving and very helpful during difficult or confusing times. It helps center and align with the higher power.",

Other wood comes from friends and neighbours who have had trees trimmed or removed.

They are not perfect specimen pieces – they are real pieces of wood complete with marks, knots, cracks, twists and warps.  Many are turned ‘green’ (which means fairly fresh after being cut and still quite wet) and as such will continue to dry and find their final shape for some time yet.  This is a natural process and only adds to the unique character of each individual piece.  \n\nThey are all finished with either wax or oil, see the in individual descriptions for each bowl.  They are ‘food safe’ for use as fruit bowls but I would not recommend using them to eat from.  They would benefit from the occasional waxing (standard furniture wax is fine) or oiling (walnut oil from the supermarket is good), just a light wipe is fine to keep them looking their best.  \n\nDon’t  soak in water (wipe with a damp cloth and dry straight away) and avoid direct sunlight for any extended period.

Alle Materialien werden vorab auf den Energielevel des Körpers ausgetestet.\n\nHerstellung\nDie Ketten werden von Hand in der Schweiz hergestellt.\n\nIonen-Eigenschaft\nAlle Ketten haben einen Negativ-Ionenwert zwischen 5000-7000/cm3. Die genaue Anzahl ist mit einem Etikett an dem Schmuck versehen.\n\nDIE POSITIVE WIRKUNG VON NEGATIV IONEN\n\nUnser gesundheitliches Wohlbefinden und unsere Leistungsfähigkeit hängen zum grossen Teil auch von der Qualität der Luft ab, die wir einatmen. Diese Luft ist erfüllt mit sogenannten Ionen. Man unterscheidet hierbei Aufgrund deren Elektrischer Ladung zwischen Positiv- und Negativ-Ionen, wobei letzteres als für den Menschen gesundheitsfördernd gilt. Das Grundmaterial ist Holzpulver aus diversen Hölzer, welches mit verschiedenen Negativ-Ionenpulvern vermischt wird. Durch das Holz ist die Kette sehr leicht und kaum bis nicht spürbar, daher wird sie von unseren Kunden oft auch im Bett getragen.\n\nDer Energieschmuck wirkt auf den Körper. Man kann innert Sekunden eine Verbesserung der Schmerzpunkte wahrnehmen.\nDurch diverse Umwelteinflüsse, wie Elektrosmog, langes Arbeiten am Computer, Kunststoffe, Umweltgifte allgemein, Staubpartikel, Aufenthalt in geschlossenen Räumen werden dem Körper vermehrt pos. Ionen zugeführt, was zu einer Disbalance der Ionen im Organismus führt. Durch das Tragen einer SWISS Ionen Kette ist für die optimale Balance an neg. und pos. Ionen im Organismus gesorgt. Diese sollte bei etwa 60 zu 40 liegen. Durch eine erhöhte Anzahl von pos. Ionen im Organismus können sich Muskeln verkrampfen, Gifte ablagern, der Sauerstoff nicht voll verwertet werden und freie Radikale frei werden. Das Tragen des Schmuckes sorgt für eine zusätzliche Zufuhr an neg. Ionen was zu einer deutlichen Verbesserung des allgemeinen Wohlbefindens dient. Der Körper hat mehr Energie und regeneriert sich schneller und die Zellen können besser entgiftet werden, da Umweltgifte sich nicht mehr so gut andocken können. Die Ketten geben zwischen 5000-7000 neg. Ionen pro 3cm Luft ab und dies über Jahre.",

They are made to order based on the ideas you give me for your personal blanket.  The possibilities are endless as fleece patterns range from solid colors to Disney characters to wildlife animals...prices vary depending on the fleece you choose.  I usually recommend doing either two solid fleece colors or one solid and one pattern.  These blankets are fine quality and I take the time to put great effort into making sure they will last. They are easy to clean via laundry machine.  Sizes range from 4ft blankets to 9 ft. Prices are subject to change based on the size and/or fleece pattern you choose. Message me for inquiries and quotes. If you aren&#39;t sure if the pattern you like exists, message me and I will let you know. $30 is not a fixed price. That is the cheapest blanket I&#39;ve made - it&#39;s a starting price. Blankets may range from $30-60.  These prices may seem high but they cover the cost of supplies.  This craft is a hobby of mine so my goal isn&#39;t to overcharge anyone.",

    "description": "The power and strength both physically and mentally are what stand out to the viewer straight away followed closely by the attitude the physical gesture may suggest. Atlas is a fitting name for a Mustang as such strength is required to survive out in the wild , now more than ever.\n\nAcrylic paint on stretched canvas with a varnish finish.\n\nW 76 cm L 61 cm Depth 4.5 cm\n\nAtlas was inspired by the effect of a documentary I watched about the wild Mustangs of North America and the trials they must endure daily to survive .\nI used the knife a lot in this piece and I think it added a nice effect to the overall feel of the painting which for me is about having the strength to survive.",

Dating from the Vietnam war this excellent condition leather G-1 flight jacket with fur collar is size 42” and has a patch on the left breast for the Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 2 that reads “HC-2 Fleet Angels”. Also, on left breast is the name of the Naval Aviator that wore this jacket, the patch reads DICK LAVIGNE, FLEET ANGEL.\n\nOn the right breast is a very rare ANDROS RANGES AUTEC Patch. Anyone who has spent much time around either submarines or the Bahamas is likely to have heard of something called AUTEC. Not many people know much about it since it involves submarines and testing to ensure the subs and their weapons work well. AUTEC’s main base is on Andros Island, a short flight from Nassau. A key part of AUTEC is its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Naval Forces Sensor and Weapons Accuracy Check Sites (FORACS), known as NFA. AUTEC was picked for its access to the Tongue of the Ocean, a remarkable site protected from the open Atlantic so ambient noise is at a minimum.\n\nOn the right arm is a third patch that reads NAVAL UNDERWATER SYSTEMS CENTER.\n\nThe &quot;G-1&quot; military flight jacket is the commonly accepted name for the fur-lined-collar World War II-era flight jacket of the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. The G-1 remains a current uniform-issue item in naval aviation for officer and enlisted aviation personnel on flying status in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard (i.e., Naval Aviator, Naval Flight Officer, Naval Flight Surgeon, Naval Aircrewman, etc.) and is arguably best known as the leather flight jacket as worn by Tom Cruise in the film Top Gun.",

    "description": "Куколка-мотанка на счастье или Доля. Одна из самых «светлых» традиционных кукол. Приносит счастье своей обладательнице и помогает найти свое призвание в жизни. Длинная коса – символ женской силы, красоты и здоровья). Делается без использования иголки с добрыми мыслями и пожеланиями :) Хотите впустить счастье в свой дом? Пригласите в него куколку-мотанку Счастье ;)\nКуколка на счастье имеет своеобразные лапоточки; они помогают ей на пути поиска счастья. Коса как символ женского начала и женской силы обозначает здоровье, достаток, красоту и долгую жизнь. Лучше всего, если коса направлена вверх и вперёд - к новым достижениям и новым успехам (также это делает куклу более устойчивой, она как бы опирается на свою косу).\nВ русских народных сказках, где герои ищут своё счастье, Долюшка упоминается как куколка-помощница. Так и сейчас считается, что если носить такую куколку с собой, то будет сопутствовать успех, и владелица найдёт своё счастье.\nЯ с радостью сделаю для Вас и ваших близких такой оберег по вашим предпочтениям, например, в цвете. Пишите свои пожелания, пусть и в вашем доме царит гармония.\nРазмер 8 см\n\nDoll motanka happiness or share. One of the &quot;light&quot; of traditional dolls. It brings happiness and helps its owner to find his calling in life. Long braid - a symbol of female strength, health and beauty). Done without the use of needles with good thoughts and wishes :) Do you want to let happiness into your home? Invite to a doll-motanku Happiness;)\nDolly has a peculiar happiness boots; they help her in the search for happiness. Spit as a symbol of femininity and feminine power represents health, wealth, beauty and long life. It is best if the braid is directed upward and forward - to new achievements and new successes (as it makes the doll more sustainable, it seems to be based on his scythe).\nIn Russian folk tales, where the characters seek happiness, Dolyushka referred to as a doll-assistant. So now it is believed that if you wear a doll with them, it will be successful, and the owner will find their happiness.\nI am happy to do for you and your loved ones a guardian to your preference, for example, in color. Write your wishes even in your house harmony reigns.",

    "name": "Original U.S. WWII China Burma India Theater A2 Leather Flight Jacket (Size 40) [GLT2003|",
    "description": "Original Item: One-of-a-kind. This is a nice but well worn A2 leather flight jacket issued to a pilot who served in the Pacific Theatre during WW2. It is good condition in a large size 40 chest. There is wear evident in the leather with fraying with and holes in cotton waist band and cuffs, but overall it is solid and wearable.\n\nThe best aspect of this incredible jacket is the embroidered U.S. eagle on the left breast along with a genuine CBI patch on the left shoulder along with a set of Captains bars.\n\nThe Type A-2 leather flight jacket is a military flight jacket closely associated with World War II U.S. Army Air Forces pilots, navigators and bombardiers, who often decorated their jackets with squadron patches and elaborate artwork painted on the back. Sometimes casually referred to as a bomber jacket, its original designation was &quot;Jacket, Pilot&#39;s (summer)&quot;, and its wartime usage was limited neither to pilots nor to bomber crews. The A-2 jacket was awarded to an Army Air Forces officer upon completion of basic flight training, and always before graduating to advanced training. No standard system of distribution was used, though generally airmen lined up in front of boxes containing jackets of various sizes and given the appropriate size jacket by the base quartermaster. A-2s were exclusive to commissioned officers until early in World War II, when also issued to enlisted aircrews. The A-2 was a treasured item to the airman and was worn with as much pride as his wings. As airmen progressed through various duty stations they often added and removed squadron patches, rank marks, and occasionally elaborate artwork depicting the type of aircraft they flew or a copy of the artwork painted on their airplane. Bomber crews often added small bombs to the right front of their jackets indicating the number of missions they had flown. As a result, many jackets ended up with numerous stitch marks as patches of various sizes were removed and replaced when the owner changed units. Unlike Navy aviators, who often wore the patches of every squadron they had ever flown with, AAF personnel could only display the patch of their current assignment. The emblem of the Army Air Forces was often sewn, painted, or applied by decal on the left shoulder, while the shield of the specific Air Force (5th, 8th, etc.) was often displayed on the right. Despite the A-2&#39;s becoming a symbol of the American pilot, in 1943 General H. H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold canceled any further leather jacket contracts in favor of newer cloth-shell jackets like the B-10 and B-15. Needless to say, Arnold&#39;s popularity with his airmen was not improved by his decision. Even after the transition to cloth, existing units could still order replacement A-2s, keeping production going well into 1944. And it was impossible to prevent airmen from continuing to obtain and wear the style – as demonstrated by the large number of photos clearly showing Korean War pilots of F-82&#39;s and F-86&#39;s still wearing the original A-2 issued to them a decade earlier, or newer jackets made to fit their current sizes. Fighter pilots, who often had heated cockpits, could wear the A-2 into combat more easily. Some jackets had a map of the mission area sewn into the lining, which could be used (in theory) for navigation if shot down. Some jackets (famously, those from the China Burma India Theater, and of the Flying Tigers) had a &quot;Blood chit&quot; sewn on the lining or outer back, printed on cloth, which promised certain rewards to civilians who aided a downed airman. In certain ETO units and possibly elsewhere a prerogative of the fighter ace was a red satin lining which was added on confirmation of his fifth aerial kill. Early wartime pictures show entire bomber crews outfitted with A-2s, although at altitude in a bomber they probably weren&#39;t too useful. The pilot and copilot had primitive cabin heat on some aircraft and would wear the A-2, while the rest of the bomber crew usually wore heavier fleece-lined Type B-3 or ANJ-4 (and later B-9 and B-11 parkas) which were warmer and better suited to long hours in the severe cold. However, period photos do show A-2s worn by crew underneath heavy outer garments, and candid on-base photos often show crewmen of all ranks in A-2s. A warm and comfortable mouton collar was an addition authorized in mountainous C-B-I commands.",

    "name": "Original WWII Guinness Advertising Oil on Canvas Artwork by John Gilroy - 1944 Royal Air Force Bomber Crew [ON8500]",
    "description": "Original Item: One-of-a-kind. This is a fascinating story! We&#39;ve all heard of Guinness, a popular Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness (1725–1803) at St. James&#39;s Gate, Dublin. Guinness is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide. It is brewed in nearly 60 countries and is available in over 120, with annual sales totaling 850 million liters (1.5 billion Imperial or 1.8 billion US pints).\n\nWell, what we have here is an original oil painting by the dedicated Guinness advertising account artist John Gilroy. These painting were first created and once approved internally by the advertising agency and then the client (in this case Guinness) posters would be printed and pasted all over the UK.\n\nThis particular example is one of the very few WW2 Guinness advertisements. It reads:\n\nGUINNESS FOR STRENGTH\n\n\nThis completely authentic first generation oil painting is beautifully preserved and framed. It even still bears the original paper S.H. Benson advertising agency paper tag that is clearly dated 1944.\n\nThe tag reads as follows:\n\nS.H. Benson\n-Advertising Agency-\nClient: Guinness\nAccount: GE/44\nArtist: GILROY\nAction: SUBMIT TO CENSOR\n\n\n\nGuinness&#39;s iconic stature is partly due to its advertising, the most notable and recognizable series of advertisements was created by S.H. Benson&#39;s advertising, primarily drawn by the artist John Gilroy, in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nBenson created posters that included phrases such as &quot;Guinness for Strength&quot;, &quot;Lovely Day for a Guinness&quot;, &quot;Guinness Makes You Strong,&quot; &quot;My Goodness My Guinness,&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;My Goodness, My Christmas, It&#39;s Guinness!&quot;) and, &quot;Guinness is Good For You&quot;. The posters featured Gilroy&#39;s distinctive artwork and more often than not featured animals such as a kangaroo, ostrich, seal, lion and notably a toucan, which has become as much a symbol of Guinness as the harp.\n\nThis particular painting depicts a member of a WW2 Bomber&#39;s ground crew carrying 1,000 lb. bomb over his shoulder to load onto an Avro Lancaster bomber airplane. Standing beside him is an oil drum with an empty glass and a bottle of Guinness next to it (as if he has just drunk it, like Popeye eats spinach).\n\nThe painting measures 34 inches wide by 28 inches high. The original canvas was mounted on board and one can still see the thumbtack impressions along the margins. The painting is signed GILROY in the bottom left corner.\n\nA charming advertisement intended to boost morale during WW2, and one of only a very few in Gilroy’s short-lived Guinness WWII series, making it not only one-of-a-kind but extremely rare.\n\nIncluded with this framed painting comes a signed copy of the 255 page book; GILROY WAS GOOD FOR GUINNESS. The book shows Gilroy’s history with Guinness and illustrates this very painting on page 177.\n\nGilroy was Great Britain&#39;s Norman Rockwell and a treasure trove has been discovered, over the next years the prices will skyrocket and especially on those few that have a piece from the extremely rare WW2 series.\n\n\nFounded by Arthur Guinness, 1725-1803, this dark nectar was first marketed in 1778. It has climbed in popularity over the next 235 years. In 1932 it moved it&#39;s headquarters from Dublin to London and was then rated the 7th largest Company in the world. On moving to London Guinness contracted with the S. H. Benson Advertising Agency and for the next thirty years one of the greatest advertising campaigns came into being. Basically this was all because of the renowned commercial artist JOHN GILROY. England&#39;s equivalent to Norman Rockwell.\n\nFor thirty years Gilroy created some of the most loved Post Advertising of all time. He created the famous Zoo Series including his use of animals, such as Ostriches, Toucans and Gnus, a WW2 Series, an Old Masters series, an Olympic series for 1948 London Games and an Exotic Automobile series as well as countless others.\n\nThe point was to promote the benefits that &quot;Guinness was Good For You&quot;, and &quot;Guinness For Strength&quot;, creating a truly enchanting series of Campaigns that are still near to many people&#39;s hearts.\n\nIn 1962 a new Marketing team joined Guinness and terminated its contracts with Bensons and within short order the S.H. Benson advertising agency closed down with all it&#39;s archives being placed in storage. In 2010 this came to light and over 200 original oil paintings, original works of John Gilroy, were discovered. Any Gilroy work will now become a most rewarding investment. John Gilroy Died in 1985 just a month short of his 87th birthday.",

    "name": "Original 19th Century European Hussar Officer’s Pelisse [ON2929]",
    "description": "Original Item: Only one available. The style of uniform incorporating the pelisse originated with the Hussar mercenaries of Hungary in the 17th Century. As this type of light cavalry unit became popular in Western Europe, so too did their dress. In the 19th century pelisses were in use throughout most armies in Europe, and even some in North and South America.\n\nIn appearance the pelisse was characteristically a very short and extremely tight fitting (when worn) jacket, the cuffs and collar of which were trimmed with fur. The jacket was further decorated with patterns sewn in bullion lace. The front of the jacket was distinctive and featured several rows of parallel frogging and loops, and either three or 5 lines of buttons. For officers of British Hussars this frogging, regimentally differentiated, was generally of gold or silver bullion lace, to match either gold (gilt) or silver buttons. Other ranks had either yellow lace with brass buttons or white lace with &#39;white-metal&#39; buttons. Lacing varied from unit to unit and country to country. The pelisse was usually worn slung over the left shoulder, in the manner of a short cloak, over a jacket of similar style - but without the fur lining or trim - called a dolman jacket. It was held in place by a lanyard. In cold weather the pelisse could be worn over the dolman.\n\nThe prevalence of this style began to wane towards the end of the 19th Century, but it was still in use by some cavalry regiments in the Imperial German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies up until World War I. The two hussar regiments of the Spanish Army retained pelisses until 1931.\n\nThis beautiful red Pelisse features gilt rope, gold finish brass painted buttons, black wool “fur” trim, and is offered in good condition. We estimate it to date from the middle of the 19th century but it could be earlier. We are also unsure of the origin, as many armies from Russia, Germany, Austria, France, England and more copied the styles, patterns and look. The interior lining shows wear and there are small stitch repairs throughout, but overall a splendidly appealing Pelisse that will add flare to any 19th century collection!",

    "description": "Original Item: Selections vary in age from late WW2 through the early 1950s. Official designation of Pack, Field, Cargo M-1945 is constructed of sturdy OD#7 canvas. The cargo pack belongs to the original Combat Field Pack M-1945 set, but may also be separately used as a carrying bag.\n\nOffered in surplus usable condition, free of major defects, but expect wear from age and use. Most show U.S. marking on outer flap and have the large instruction sheet printed on a white label inside the bag with drawings and detailed descriptions of how to pack and use the components. Comes complete with web carry handle and canvas straps.\n\nMeasures approximately 16&quot; long x 6&quot; wide x 10&quot; tall.\n\nHistory of the Pack, Field, Combat, M-1945 and Pack, Field, Cargo, M-1945\n\nPack, Field, Cargo and Pack, Field, Combat M-1944 were soon replaced by the very similar M-1945 version. But the combat and cargo packs of the two are not interchangeable. The quick release buckles of the M-1944 packs will not work with the double-bar buckles used with the M-1945 version. M-1945 Combat Suspenders were issued to match the packs. These packs were only used by a few units in the last days of World War II (perhaps after February 1945) but continued to be made and remained in service through the Korean War.\n\nThe Field Pack (upper) had a waterproof liner, interior divisions, and numerous straps to close the main flap, to use as shoulder straps or attach to the suspenders, and to hold the entrenching tool handle. Two canvas flaps with eyelets were provided: M-1943 entrenching tool on top center, and a side flap for bayonet or canteen. Bottom straps attached to the Cargo Pack to join the two.\n\nThe Cargo Pack (lower) had a waterproof closure inside; two straps to close the main flap and short buckle straps on top to mate to the straps on the bottom of the Field Pack. The Cargo Pack also had a web handle on top making it a handy furlough bag or even a tool bag.\n\nBoth parts of the packs were made in OD #7 canvas and webbing with &quot;US&quot; stamped on the outside of the flap and the manufacturer and date on the inside of the flap. A large instruction sheet was printed on a white label inside the bag with drawings and detailed descriptions of how to pack and use the components.",
